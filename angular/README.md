# Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.2.

## Running tests

Run the following:

    ./node_modules/.bin/ng test --browsers Chrome

then use the Chrome window which appears to view the test output.
(The window will take 10-30s to appear, after things get compiled. Be patient.)

To debug tests, open the Chrome devtools window.

To run a single test, click its name in the test output in Chrome.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can
also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored
in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
