                    You may be exempt from the need to make improvements to the property under the Minimum Energy

                        Based on the information you have provided your property is covered by the Minimum Energy
                        Efficiency Standards regulations and you will now need to take steps to improve the EPC score to
                        E.

                    <p>
                        When you’ve installed improvements, you’ll need to get your EPC evaluated again.
                        If the property is now rated E or above then you are compliant with the legislation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, if there are legitimate reasons why the property cannot be improved to E, you may
                        qualify for an exemption which you can register for
