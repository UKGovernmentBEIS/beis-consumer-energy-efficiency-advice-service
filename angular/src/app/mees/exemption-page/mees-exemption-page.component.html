                                It is not practical to provide an exhaustive list of all situations where third party
                                consent requirements may apply. Information on when and where consent is required will
                                be contained within relevant documentation, for example in the landlord’s lease or
                                mortgage conditions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Information Required: when registering an exemption of this type the landlord will need
                                to upload to the register, a copy of any correspondence and/or relevant documentation
                                demonstrating that consent for a relevant energy efficiency measure was required and
                                sought, and that this consent was refused, or was granted subject to a condition that
                                the landlord was not reasonably able to comply with.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once registered, the exemption will generally last five years; after this time it will
                                expire and the landlord must try again to improve the property’s EPC rating to meet the
                                minimum level of energy efficiency. If this cannot be achieved then a further exemption
                                may be registered. Please note however that, where improvements cannot be made because
                                consent could not be obtained from the current tenant of the property, the exemption
                                will only remain valid for as long as that tenant remains the tenant. The improvement
                                would then need to be made before the property is let on a new tenancy.
                            </p>

                                An exemption from meeting the minimum standard will apply where the landlord has
                                obtained a report from an independent surveyor who is on the Royal Institution of

                                specific energy efficiency measures would reduce the market value of the property, or
                                the building it forms part of, by more than five per cent.

                                The Regulations acknowledge that there are some, limited circumstances where a person
                                may have become a landlord suddenly and as such it would be inappropriate or
                                unreasonable for them to be required to comply with the Regulations immediately. If a
                                person becomes a landlord in any of the circumstances set out below, a temporary
                                exemption from the prohibition on letting a sub-standard property, or on continuing to
                                let a sub-standard property, will apply. The exemption will last for six months from the
                                date they become the landlord.

                                    the grant of a lease due to a contractual obligation (this is intended to cover a
                                    situation where a contract was entered into on a contingent basis, regardless of
                                    whether it was entered into before or after the Regulations came into force);

                                    (in this situation, the tenant’s guarantor becomes a landlord when taking over the
                                    lease);

                                    the landlord has been a guarantor, or a former tenant, who has exercised the right
                                    to obtain an overriding lease of a property under section 19 of the Landlord and
                                    Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 (for the avoidance of doubt, a “guarantor” who exercises
                                    this right under the 1995 Act is the guarantor of a former tenant);

                                    a new lease has been granted under Part 2 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954;

                                    a new lease has been granted by a court order, other than under Part 2 of the
                                    Landlord and Tenant Act 1954.

                                Additionally, from 1 April 2020, when the minimum standard applies to all privately
                                rented properties that are occupied by tenants, a temporary exemption of six months will
                                apply from the date from which a person became a landlord in the following situation:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    A person becomes the landlord on purchasing an interest in a property and, on the
                                    date of the purchase, it was let on an existing tenancy.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                In all cases landlords are advised to obtain their own independent legal advice if they
                                are unsure about whether any of these temporary ‘recent landlord’ exemptions apply in
                                their case.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Information Required: if registering this exemption, the landlord must provide the date
                                on which they became the landlord for the property, and a narrative explanation of the
                                circumstances under which they became the landlord (any of the circumstances listed
                                above).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The exemption will last for six months from the date from which the landlord became the
                                landlord. After six months the exemption will expire and the landlord must either have
                                improved the energy efficiency of the property to at least EPC band E, or have
                                registered another valid exemption (should one apply), if they intend to continue
                                letting.
