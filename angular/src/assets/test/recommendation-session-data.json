          "readMore": "If your home has cavity walls, and they're suitable for insulation, then you'll need a specialist company to insulate them. They will drill holes in the mortar joints of your outside walls and inject insulation through the holes until the cavity has been filled. The holes are then re-filled with mortar to match the original.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe most common materials are:<br />\r\n•\tMineral wool – like loft insulation rolls, but chopped up so it can be blown into the cavity<br />\r\n•\tPolystyrene beads – small spheres of expanded polystyrene. A bonding agent is added so that the beads will stay in place.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSometimes foam insulation is injected, and this then sets rigid inside the cavity. This is more expensive than standard cavity wall insulation, but can be used in many situations where standard materials aren't suitable. It's also a particularly effective insulant.<br />\r\n",

          "readMore": "Before about 1920, most houses in the UK were built with solid walls – that is, the outside walls were made of a single solid layer of brick or stone. After 1920 it became increasingly common to build houses with an inner and an outer leaf with an air gap in between. This is known as a cavity wall, as opposed to a solid wall with no air gap.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom about 1982, some houses were built with insulation in the gap between the inner and the outer leaf. If your house was built after 1995 then it probably does have cavity walls but they are probably already insulated, and it is unlikely that adding any further insulation would be worthwhile. However, many houses built between 1982 and 2000 were built with uninsulated cavities, so it could be worth checking.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome homes are not built of standard brick, stone or concrete block. Cavity wall insulation is usually not suitable for these.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome homes built with uninsulated cavities are not suitable for standard insulation, including:<br />\r\n•\tVery narrow or uneven cavities<br />\r\n•\tAreas with high exposure to driving rain<br />\r\n•\tAreas with a high risk of flooding<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome of these houses may be suitable for more expensive foam injection, but some may not be suitable for any form of cavity insulation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you are in any doubt about whether you could have cavity wall insulation, ask a certified installer to visit. They can carry out a survey to determine if your walls are suitable and, if so, what materials can be used.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf your house has solid walls, or any other wall type that is not suitable for cavity insulation, then it may still be possible to insulate it.<br />\r\n",
