   =
   = TODO:BEIS-163 update terminology here to match GOV.UK
   = Changelogs which have been released to "test" or "live" must not be modified.
   = If you find a mistake in such a changelog, you must create a second fixup
   = changelog to correct it.
   =
   = Changelogs which have not yet been released beyond "int" may be modified, but
   = it is better to avoid doing so.
   =
   = Please add Changelogs in the same commit as the code which uses the new schema,
   = so that changes are atomic and the codebase is in a consistent state.
   =
   = See http://www.liquibase.org/quickstart.html
   =
   = ####### MySQL, H2 and development
   =
   = The database on developers' machines and on the CI server runs H2, which is
   = fast to boot and needs no external dependencies.
   = The database in production runs on MySQL, which is performant at large scale.
   =
   = There are some differences in the SQL syntax and supported features of the
   = two databases, so please test your changes (both the changelog and the
   = supported feature) in both if you are doing anything unusual.
   =
   = Key areas where we have seen issues:
   =   * boolean typed columns; boolean literals
   =   * default column values
   =   * date handling (precision)
   =   * column comments
   =   * UPDATE FROM and complex update syntax
