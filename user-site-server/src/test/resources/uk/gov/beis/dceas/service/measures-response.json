You can do much the same thing by leaving the original window in place and fitting an extra pane to the inside. This is called secondary glazing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are several ways to go about this, from cheap DIY jobs to more effective, but more expensive, professional installation. Some common approaches are:<br />\r\n•\tFitting thin film (a bit like cling film) directly onto the window frame – cheap and easy DIY fix – limited effectiveness and short life.<br />\r\n•\tFitting acrylic sheet directly to the frame using a proprietary fixing system – more difficult DIY job – lasts longer than film, and can be removed to open the window and then replaced.<br />\r\n•\tProfessionally fitted openable window, fitted in the window recess – effective, long lasting and neat – more expensive than DIY options.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSecondary glazing cuts heat loss by creating a layer of trapped air. This is different to draught-proofing which stops air blowing through the gaps around the edge of the window. To get the most benefit from secondary glazing, you should draught-proof the existing window first. This way, the trapped air really will be trapped.",
