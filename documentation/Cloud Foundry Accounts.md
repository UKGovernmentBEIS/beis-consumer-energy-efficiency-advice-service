# Cloud Foundry Accounts

To obtain a Cloud Foundry account please contact support@govuk.zendesk.com 

Please quote the project name and CC someone at BEIS with a message like
"I am working on xyz for abc, please can you give me an account with access to 123"

After this you'll need to find a project admin to grant you access (e.g. somebody already on the team)
